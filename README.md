# Tangram Decision Making Model

This repository presents the Tangram Decision Making Model, a novel idea for structuring decision-making, as seen in my Substack article [link to be provided].

## Overview

Large language models (LLMs) often overwhelm users with divergent questions, such as “What’s the purpose of this app?” or “Any specific formats needed?”, spiraling into fractal complexity with queries like “What if offline access fails?” In contrast, real-life decision-making funnels to key outcomes, like “Build this app” or “Launch this product,” after sufficient exploration. The Tangram Decision Making Model frames decisions as a puzzle, filling a Decision Scope with questions, leveraging LLM’s neural net approach to quantify decision scope and coverage, allowing the LLM to switch to convergent questioning like real-life human teams.

## Model

The Tangram Decision Making Model conceptualizes a decision as an odd-shaped space, **D (Decision Scope)**, encompassing all relevant components, such as features and UI for an app, or market and product for a startup. Questions act as discrete tangram pieces, varying from broad (e.g., “What’s the purpose?”, covering ~40% of D) to specific (e.g., “Any specific formats?”, ~10%) to edge cases (e.g., “What if offline fails?”, ~1%). These pieces are placed semi-intentionally, reflecting linguistic and conceptual constraints, to incrementally fill D across rounds (n=1,2,3...).

The model’s core metric, **A_n × S_n²**, balances question impact (**A_n**, average % of D covered per question, derived from user ratings) against complexity (**S_n²**, squared question count). Early rounds feature broad questions with high A_n (e.g., n=1, A_n = 8%, S_n = 3, for “What’s the core need?”), peaking at clarity (e.g., n=3, A_n = 5%, S_n = 12, ~85% of D). As questions become specific, A_n drops and S_n surges (e.g., n=5, A_n = 1%, S_n = 25, for “What if competitors copy?”), signaling a need to shift to convergent questions (e.g., “What’s essential?”) to finalize decisions (e.g., “Text notes app”). This mirrors real-life funnelling, robust across simple (e.g., app specs) or complex (e.g., policy plans) decision spaces and dimensions (e.g., 2D features or 3D market strategies).

## Decisions

- **Discrete Structure**: Questions as discrete tangram pieces reflect linguistic and conceptual limits, unlike continuous models (e.g., gas diffusion), enabling incremental coverage of D.
- **Quadratic Penalty**: The S_n² term penalizes fractal question sprawl, amplifying complexity costs (e.g., S_n = 25 → 625) to highlight convergence points, akin to regularization but tailored to question-driven processes.

## Applications

- **Software Development**: For an app, D includes features and UI. Questions like “What’s the purpose?” (~40% of D) and “Any specific formats?” (~10%) drive coverage, converging to “Text notes app” at ~85% of D (n=3).
- **Startups**: D spans market and product. Questions like “What’s our market?” (~30%) and “What if competitors copy?” (~5%) build clarity, finalizing “Launch MVP” at ~80% (n=4).
- **Policy Planning**: D covers congestion and cost. Questions like “What’s the goal?” (~35%) and “Any specific routes?” (~10%) lead to “Build rail system” at ~80% (n=3).
- **Personal Choices**: D includes skills and passion. Questions like “What fulfills me?” (~35%) and “Any risks?” (~5%) converge to “Join startup” at ~90% (n=3).

## Conclusion

The Tangram Decision Making Model tames LLM-driven divergent chaos, structuring decisions as a puzzle solved with precise, varied questions. It empowers developers, founders, and planners to achieve clarity and converge on actionable outcomes, bridging human-AI synergy with real-world focus.
